Perhaps the simplest and most common rhetorical device, alliteration is the repetition of the same letter or sound at the beginning of nearby words.

- Cool as a cucumber
- Dead as a doornail
- Curiosity killed the cat

When alliteration is overdone, it grinds my gears. One must be subtle, otherwise the phrase can turn into a tongue twister.

Alliteration is closely related to [consonance](/consonance) and [assonance](/assonance).

Anadiplosis is repeating the last word of a phrase as the first word in the next one. It comes from the Greek word for folding, _diploun_, which is also the root of the word "diploma."

- Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. (Yoda)
- The general who became a slave. The slave who became a gladiator. The gladiator who defied an emperor. (Gladiator)
- We also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance, perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not disappoint us. (Romans 5:3-5)
- In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void. (Genesis 1:1-2)

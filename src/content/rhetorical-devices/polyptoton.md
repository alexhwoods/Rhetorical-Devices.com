Polyptoton is repeating a word in a different form, coming from the Greek word for "many cases."

- Never say never
- Give us this day our daily bread...forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us
- Nothing succeeds like success

Neil Armstrong, as he stepped onto the moon, said, "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind." Unfortunately, the static took away the "a" and we were left with something a bit nonsensical.

Of course, one of the most famous pop culture references, [All You Need is Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7xMfIp-irg) by the Beatles.

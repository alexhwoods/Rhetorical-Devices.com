Antithesis is contrasting ideas, in a parallel structure.

- Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.
- It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. It was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness.
- To err is human; to forgive, divine.
- Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.

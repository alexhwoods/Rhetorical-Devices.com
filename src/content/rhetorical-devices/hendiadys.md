Hendiadys is when you take a phrase of the form _adjective_ _noun_ and turn the adjective into a separate noun.

- _He came despite the rain and weather_, instead of _He came despite the rainy weather_. [1]
- _This coffee is nice and warm_, instead of _This coffee is nicely warm_.

Instead of "her moonlit beauty", you might say "her beauty and the moonlight":

<div class="w-full h-48 sm:h-72 md:h-80 xl:h-[472px] flex justify-center">
  <iframe class="h-full w-full sm:w-5/6 lg:w-4/6 xl:w-full rounded" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y8AWFf7EAc4?si=2Itm-RXARQIMeVrG&amp;start=135&amp;end=142&amp;rel=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

However, just because you see an "and", does not make it hendiadys. For example, "here and now" is not hendiadys, because "here" and "now" describe different things.

In fact, hendiadys can be tricky to know if it occurred. Does "law and order" describe "lawful order"? It's not clear.

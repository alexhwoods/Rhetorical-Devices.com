The opposite of [anaphora](/rhetorical-devices/anaphora), epistrophe is where you repeat a word or phrase at the end of successive clauses or sentences.

- _When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child_ (1 Corinthians 13:11)
- I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
- "There is no Negro problem. There is no Southern problem. There is no Northern problem. There is only an American problem." (Lyndon B. Johnson)

Barack Obama and Bob the Bulder both have liking for this, always ending eventually on "Yes we can".

A rhetorical question is one that does not meant to be answered. This can be for many different reasons.

## Simply for Effect

Or, instead of simply saying "yes", you might say "Is water wet?".

You also may be belitting a person, as in "Do you even know what you're talking about?".

## Questions that don't have answers

In Ayn Rand's _Atlas Shrugged_, characters ask "Who is John Galt?" as a way of expressing their hopelessness with the world.

Similarly, in the book of Job, Job despairs - "Why died I not from the womb?".

Or when somebody says, "How could you!?".

In English, we have a strict word order. For example, adjectives must be in the following order:

1. Quantity or number
2. Quality or opinion
3. Size
4. Age
5. Shape
6. Color
7. Proper adjective
8. Purpose or qualifier

"the big red barn" is correct; "the red big barn" is not.

And it's not just adjectives - the young people are not listening to "hop hip", and the clock does not "tock tick".

Especially for native English speakers, if you get one of these many rules wrong, it sounds off.

## Hyperbaton

However, if done well, we don't call it wrong - we call it hyperbaton.

For example, "This, I must see". Or "uneasy lies the head that wears the crown".

Of course, there is a little green Jedi master who speaks almost exclusively in hyperbaton.

- When you look at the dark side, careful you must be.
- Much to learn, you still have.
- Size matters not.

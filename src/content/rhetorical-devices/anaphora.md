# Anaphora

Anaphora is repeating the same word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses or sentences. It comes from the Greek word for "carrying back."

- Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. (1 Corinthians 13:4-7)

Perhaps the simplest and most common rhetorical device, alliteration is the repetition of the same letter or sound at the beginning of nearby words.

- Cool as a cucumber
- Dead as a doornail
- Curiosity killed the cat

Alliteration is closely related to [consonance](/devices/consonance) and [assonance](/devices/assonance).

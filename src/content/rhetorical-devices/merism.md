Merism, ladies and gentlemen, is when you take a nice clean whole, and unnecessarily divide it into its parts.

- The good, the bad, and the ugly
- The heavens and the earth

If you are writing an essay, and searching high and low for a way to increase your word count, look no further than merism.

Lawyers do this an absurd amount (Mark Forsyth suggests it may have to do with billable hours). They need to cease and desist.
